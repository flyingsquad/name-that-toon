# name-that-toon
Generate random names from rollable tables that contain names.

To use:

* Import tables from the Name Tables compendium provided with this module, or create rollable tables with the names you wish to use. The description for your custom name table must contain the string "name table" somewhere in the summary description (case is ignored).

* Select tokens on the canvas that you wish to give names to. If no tokens are selected, one name will be generated and placed on the clipboard.

* Click the Name That Toon button in the Actors tab.

* Select the table(s) you wish to use to generate the name(s).

* Click Generate Names

The selected tokens, if any, will be given names drawn from the selected tables. If no tokens were selected a name will be placed on the clipboard.

If you selected any tokens that are linked to an actor, a checkbox will appear: "Also rename linked actors." If checked, any actors that are linked to selected tokens will also have their names changed.

The tables you select will be remembered in the settings for the module and be used as the default the next time you generate names.
